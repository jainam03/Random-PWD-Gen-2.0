                Why You Should Use a Strong Password Generator
            </h1>

            Using a secure password generator is a great way to create strong passwords that are harder for attackers to
            guess. Below are a few reasons why you should use a password generator.
            <br> <br>
            <b><u>

                Removes a Top Risk of a Data Breach
            </u></b>
            <br> <br>
            As mentioned earlier, weak passwords are one of the main reasons for a data breach, and a password generator
            helps eliminate that risk. According to the 2022 Weak Password Report, 93% of the passwords used in brute
            force attacks include eight or more characters, whereas only 41% of passwords used in real attacks are 12
            characters or longer.

            Password generators allow you to customize your passwords and adjust the character length and whether it
            includes uppercase or lowercase letters, numbers and special characters. Every time you click “generate,” a
            new random password is created based on your criteria.

            Humans tend to create weak passwords to make them easier to memorize. Below are some common traits of weak
            and strong passwords.

            </u></b>
            <br> <br>

            Paired with a password manager, password generators create strong passwords and store them in your
            vault—removing the responsibility of memorizing them. Suppose you are revisiting a website or application
            where your credentials are available in your digital vault. In that case, the password manager will autofill
            your login details, saving you time and preventing you from exposing your details to any keylogging software
            used by a cyberattacker.

            A cloud-based password manager with a generator will give you access to your credentials across multiple
            devices, allowing you to access your passwords whether you’re on a desktop, mobile device or tablet.

            <b><u>

                Strengthens Overall Security
            </u></b>
            <br> <br>

            Password generators are often used with a password management tool to help secure your online accounts.
            Although you can create strong passwords using a password generator, it might be difficult for you to
            memorize several different passwords without using a password management tool. Password managers provide an
            encrypted vault to protect your passwords and other information such as bank accounts, payment cards,
            addresses and more.
