                Why You Should Use a Strong Password Generator
            </h1>

            Using a secure password generator is a great way to create strong passwords that are harder for attackers to
            guess. Below are a few reasons why you should use a password generator.

                Removes a Top Risk of a Data Breach
            </u></b>
            <br> <br>
            As mentioned earlier, weak passwords are one of the main reasons for a data breach, and a password generator
            helps eliminate that risk. According to the 2022 Weak Password Report, 93% of the passwords used in brute
            force attacks include eight or more characters, whereas only 41% of passwords used in real attacks are 12
            characters or longer.

            Password generators allow you to customize your passwords and adjust the character length and whether it
            includes uppercase or lowercase letters, numbers and special characters. Every time you click “generate,” a
            new random password is created based on your criteria.

            Humans tend to create weak passwords to make them easier to memorize. Below are some common traits of weak
            and strong passwords.
